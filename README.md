this is a jedi academy client mod written by teh.  most of the changes were written a very long time ago,
but they have been remade on top of the [OpenJK](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK) project, to become
up-to-date with the latest bugfixes and security improvements since raven open-sourced the entire game.

the client mod is intended to enhance the game in minor but important ways to enhance competitive play,
particularly CTF.
