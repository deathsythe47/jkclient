# teh's jedi academy client mod #

OpenJK is an effort by the JACoders group to maintain and improve the game engines on which the Jedi Academy (JA) and Jedi Outcast (JO) games run on, while maintaining *full backwards compatibility* with the existing games. *This project does not attempt to rebalance or otherwise modify core gameplay*.

this is a jedi academy client mod written by teh.  most of the changes were written a very long time ago,
but they have been remade on top of the [OpenJK](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK) project, to become
up-to-date with the latest bugfixes and security improvements since raven open-sourced the entire game.

the client mod is intended to enhance the game in minor but important ways to enhance competitive play,
particularly CTF.
